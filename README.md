Create a 2 dimensional array for the Graph Adjacent Matrix.
‚ùè Create the following Menu:
[ A ] Assign names to Nodes
[ B ] Starting Location
[ C ] Destination
[ D ] Shortest Distance
[ E ] Exit

Role Assignment:
Main() and Exit() - All
Assugn Names - Dyniel
Starting() and Destination() - Kent
ShortDistance() - Richard

Other Notes:
Make Dummy Matrix

Due Dates:
Proposed Deadline / Mock Code Review - Sept. 20, 2023
Final Deadline - Sept 21, 2023


Structure:
Algorithm: Base on Djikstra (Priority Queue)

- Ask User to Input Names for Col and Rows (Nodes)
- Distance are static and defined
- Functions that ask for EnterStarting and EnterDistance
- Functions to EvaluateSD and DisplaySD

Expected Output:
Starting Point     Destination     Shortest Distance from Starting Location
A                       C                           5
